# A Simple Repository To Pre-Build Containers with GH Actions

> This repository is created to support internal video recording.

Please send your questions directly to the author.

The repository contains a few workflow examples and container definitions to illustrate the power of Github Actions and Packages to create pre-build container images.

Following containers were created during the video session:

- a container with [Carbon Now Cli](https://github.com/mixn/carbon-now-cli) to convert all images in a directory to nice snippets. As a better replacement to [carbon.now.sh](https://carbon.now.sh/)
- a container to create Golan Jupiter notebooks, based on [GoNB](https://github.com/janpfeifer/gonb)
- a simple container with [Marpit](https://marpit.marp.app/) extension and Chromium, that we never used in this session, but may use later
- a very custom [AVD](https://avd.arista.com/) container with [Containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/), [EOS downloader](https://pypi.org/project/eos-downloader/), etc.
